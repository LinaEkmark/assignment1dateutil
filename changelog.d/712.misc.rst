Added unittests that tests for the edge case where a timezone file is loaded having all ``ttinfo``
entries with an ``isdst`` byte set to 1.

The tests check two things:

- The tzfile's ``_ttinfo_std`` becomes the same as its ``_ttinfo_dst``. This has an effect on the
``utcoffset`` function which returns a timedelta of 0 when there is no ``_ttinfo_std``.
- The tzfile's ``_ttinfo_before`` becomes the same as its first dst ttinfo entry if there are no std
entries. This has an effect on the ``dst`` function which returns the timedelta of the first ttinfo
if the input time is before all transitions.
