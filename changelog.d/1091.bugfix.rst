Add support for Internet RFC 8536 format TZif files, which contain 64-bit timestamps and TZ strings for timestamps past the last transition. This is particularly helpful for timestamps past the year 2038 and for ‘zic -b slim’, which generates smaller TZif files by exploiting RFC 8536 more aggressively. Reported by @pganssle (gh issue #462) and by @eggert (gh issue #1059). Fixed by @eggert (gh pr #1091).
